Kimidi – keyboard shortcuts to MIDI
===================================

Current version is 1.2.7 – released Dec 17, 2013.  
Compatible with OS X 10.4 up to 10.8 (10.9 untested)


This is the accompanying app for Selected_Track_Control for Ableton Live. On OS X, this app transforms global keyboard shortcuts into MIDI messages, which are sent to Ableton Live on a virtual MIDI-port (created by the app automatically itself). **This allows instant keyboard-control of lots of features in Ableton Live** that either would require prior, manual configuration of each Live-set or aren't possible at all (such as using the same keyboard shortcut for e.g. the mute button – but always on the selected track).

More information and the app itself can be found on the [project’s homepage.](http://stc.wiffbi.com/)
